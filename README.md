# Research Paper Question Answering & Recommendation System

This project provides a Question Answering and Recommendation System for research papers using DistilBERT and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Users can ask questions about research papers and receive answers, as well as get paper recommendations based on their input.

# Features
* *Question Answering:* Get answers from research papers based on input questions using DistilBERT for text extraction.
* *Paper Recommendations:* Receive paper recommendations related to the input query using semantic search techniques.

# Technologies Used
* Python
* Streamlit
* DistilBERT (Hugging Face)
* Scikit-learn
* PyTorch
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
